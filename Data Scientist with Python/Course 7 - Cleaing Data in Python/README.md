# Course Description
A vital component of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready for analysis. In fact, it is commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. This course will equip you with all the skills you need to clean your data in Python, from learning how to diagnose your data for problems to dealing with missing values and outliers. At the end of the course, you'll apply all of the techniques you've learned to a case study in which you'll clean a real-world Gapminder dataset!
