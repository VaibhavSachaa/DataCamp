# Project Description
Almost every web service you join will require you to come up with a password. But what makes a good password? In June 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published publication 800-63B titled Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management. This publication doesn't tell you what is a good password, but it does have specific rules for what is a bad password.

In this project, you will take a list of user passwords and, using [publication 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html), you will write code that automatically detects and flags the bad passwords.
